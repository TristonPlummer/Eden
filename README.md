# Shaiya Eden
Eden is designed to be a high performance Shaiya emulator, with a strong focus on being as flexible and user-friendly as possible. It is designed to run with a PostgreSQL database backend, and uses Lua for content scripting. 

## Troubleshooting
- *Where can I get a client?*
    - You can download the official Shaiya client from the AeriaGames website at https://shaiya.aeriagames.com/

## FAQ
#### I would like a feature added to the server
- If you would like a new feature added, you can either create a new feature request issue and describe the feature in depth, or you can develop the feature yourself and submit the updated code as a pull request.
#### I found a bug, where can I report it?
- You can report bugs as issues on Github.
