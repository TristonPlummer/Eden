# Shaiya Eden
Eden is designed to be a high performance Shaiya emulator, with a strong focus on being as flexible and user-friendly as possible. It is designed to run with a PostgreSQL database backend, and uses Lua for content scripting. This is intended to be a successor to the learning project that was [Shaiya Genesis](https://github.com/TristonPlummer/ShaiyaGenesisLegacy).

## Troubleshooting
- *Where can I get a client?*
    - Eden is designed to run on an Ep8 client, which may be downloaded from [Elitepvpers](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/shaiya-pserver-development/4528336-new-episode-8-unpack.html).
