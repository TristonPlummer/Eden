# Shaiya Eden
Eden is designed to be a high performance Shaiya emulator, with a strong focus on being as flexible and user-friendly as possible. It is designed to run with a PostgreSQL database backend, and uses Lua for content scripting. This is intended to be a successor to the learning project that was [Shaiya Genesis](https://github.com/TristonPlummer/ShaiyaGenesisLegacy).

## Troubleshooting
- *Where can I get a client?*
    - Eden is designed to run on the official Ep5.4 client, which may be downloaded from [Elitepvpers](https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/shaiya-pserver-guides-releases/2257246-release-official-episode-5-4-client.html).

## FAQ
#### I would like a feature added to the server
- If you would like a new feature added, you can either create a new feature request issue and describe the feature in depth, or you can develop the feature yourself and submit the updated code as a pull request.
#### I found a bug, where can I report it?
- You can report bugs as issues on Github.
